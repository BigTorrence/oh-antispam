This repo contains two little files that help us apply SpamBayes
to users on the OpenHatch site. It might be useful to maintainers
of other small-to-medium user-generated-content sites. Mostly I
wrote this file to document our approach to antispam so that we
can remember how it works when we need it again.

== Overview ==

* We mass-export user data into email-like files.

* We use an "off the shelf" anti-email-spam tool to learn which users' contents are spam. It takes about 1 minute to classify all 10,000 as spam or non-spam.

* We then semi-manually pass those usernames to the backend, which emails the users, archives their data, and then deletes them from the site.

As a side note, I wrote this in about 24 hours. The code quality is not amazing.

== Details ==

The files are

* process.py: This takes a JSON snapshot about a user, and converts it into a quoted-printable Unicode-safe email message object, and sends that to stdout.

* remove_spammy_users.py: This loops over message files created by 

To use this:

* Run mysite.profile.controllers.generate_user_export(u) on every user on the deployment, saving the results as a JSON file whose filename is the username.

* Copy those files into jsons/

* For each file in there, create a corresponding msg file by running something like:

 for thing in jsons/* ; do
     python process.py < $thing > $(echo "$thing" | sed s/jsons/msgs/)
 done

* Make sure you have trained at least one "ham" (non-spam) and "spam" user file, by running

 sb_filter -s - < msgs/some_spammy_username

 sb_filter -g - < msgs/some_non_spammy_username

* Simply run 'python remove_spammy_users.py' and it will prompt you as it learns. After every run, copy your terminal output into a file, and run a script like this:

In order to print spammy usernames:

 grep would /tmp/qqq | awk '{print $4}'  | sort | uniq

You can paste those one-by-one into the user deletion form, or probably we should make a mass user deletion form.

The next task is to move the msgs corresponding to spam users out of msgs/. To do that:

 cd msgs
 for thing in $(grep would /tmp/qqq | awk '{print $4}'  | sort | uniq )
 do              
   mv -v $thing ../known-spam
 done

* Next, you just keep running remove_spammy_users.py until it reports no spam users.
